# Dynamic Functions

This is the documentation for the dynamic functions.

Dynamic functions are executed at run time. They are intended for cases that require dynamic behavior. But they must not be used inside static functions.

| Function                                        | Description                   |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| [`merge`](./functions/merge.md)                 | Merge styles.                 |
| [`setVariables`](./functions//set-variables.md) | Update variables dynamically. |
